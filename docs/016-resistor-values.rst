Resistor Values
===============

Overview
--------

The value of any through-hole resistor can be determined by the color
bands on the resistor. While you should be able to work out the
resistance value for any resistor based on color, you should be able to
identify a  330 Ohm, 1K and 10K resistor on site.

Exercise:
~~~~~~~~~

Copy the following table into your notebook and complete for the resistors given. You can use the
`guide <https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BmZbXzxnD2j17QToSZ9jeZmnP7burwfksfQq2v4zu-Y/edit%23heading%3Dh.ex2xtjdrup0t&sa=D&ust=1587613173886000>`__ here
for assistance.
