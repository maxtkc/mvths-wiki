Variables
=========

Overview
--------

Variables are placeholders used to store values that can be modified. Just as you use *x* or *y* to represent a number in algebra, you can use *x* or *y* as a place holder for a number in your code. This is particularly useful if you have a value in your code that is going to change. For example, if you wanted to keep track of the number of times a user pressed a button you could create a variable and call it "x" or "button" (or just about anything you like) and store the number of times a button was pressed in that variable.

Initializing
------------

In order to use a variable in your code, you must first set up the variable so the program knows the type and name of the variable. We call this initializing a variable. The following are three examples of how to initialize a variable.
