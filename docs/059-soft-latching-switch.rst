Soft Latching Switch
====================

Overview
--------

A soft latching switch provides an elegant and safe way to control power
to your circuit. Unlike a mechanical latching switch which physically
disconnects power from your circuit, the soft switch is controlled by a
simple momentary switch. Press once and power is applied to the circuit.
Press again and power is removed from the circuit. This is the sort of
switch you find on most modern electronic devices. Notice that on your
cell phone there is a momentary power switch.

One complication of this design is that the power can never be
completely off. The circuit must have some power even when it is off to
detect the button press. Ideally, these types of switches draw less than
one microamp.

For this project you will be using the `Adafruit Push-button Power
Switch

Challenge
~~~~~~~~~

Set up your board so that the battery power is controlled by the power
switch shown above. Make sure to show your set to your teacher before
turning on the power to test your switch. If you need help setting up
the power switch, check out the product description on the Adafruit
