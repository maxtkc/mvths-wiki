LIGHT DISPLAY PROJECT
====================

Overview
--------

You know have all the skills you need to complete your first custom project. In this project, you will design and build a creative display that uses colored lights passing through etched clear plastic to illuminate an image. The image will be etched on clear acrylic. The box that supports the acyrlic and contains all of the electroncis can be made from wood, acrylic or metal. The electronics must be made entirely from basic components (i.e. no Arduino boards). It also must include a microcontroller and have software that is able to illuminate the image in a way that changes color and over time or in response to an external sensor. 

Design
------------

#. **Project Draft**: The first step this project is to make a draft of your project in your notebook. The draft should include a drawing for your acrylic display design and your box/base. In addition, the draft should also include a description of what your project will do. For example, my design might include an image of Superman and the display might increase in brightness as you approach it.

#. **Project Timeline**: The next step in this project is to create a project timeline for completing this project. The project timeline will be created in a spreadsheet that includes a column for tasks and columns for everyday of the project. Your job is to break down this project into a set of discrete tasks and then determine when each of these tasks will be completed. 
  
    #. Open new spreadsheet in Googlesheets
    #. Label the first column as Tasks
    #. Label the next 21 columns with the days of the week, starting with the first day of the project.
    #. Use colors to mark out the weekend dates
    #. Make a list of tasks required to complete the project in the Tasks column.
    #. Using color, indicate the dates for working on each task.

You are welcome to build the parts for this project in any order, but we want you to create a time line for your project before starting.  

Design basic microcontroller circuit on breadboard.
Set up the breadboard with USB power.
Determine how your light will change over time or in response to an external sensor.
Implement the step 3 into your breadboard design.
Design printed circuit board in CAD based directly on your breadboard circuit. (Do not print circuit yet)
Create a single project in CAD that includes:
An acrylic panel with rastered design
An imported 3D rendering of your circuit board
The main housing for your project
An LED light strip and all other components of your project.
Print parts in cardboard and assemble.
Print and assemble your circuit board.
Print final design
Specifications
Panel: 
The plastic panel will be made from clear 1/8” acrylic 
The overall size of material is limited to 64 square inches. 
The panel must fit neatly and firmly in the box (i.e. no wobble).

Box:
The base should be constructed of ¼ plywood.
The overall size of base material is limited to 100 square inches.  
The edge joints should be smooth and seamless
The box should include a single hatch for accessing the internal electronics
The size of the box should minimally fit the needs of the project.

External:
All inputs such as buttons or sensors should be neatly mounted to the sides of the box.
All external parts on the box should be clearly labeled with rasterized graphics
The box should include an externally accessible USB mount for power.
LEDS:
You may use a maximum of 8 LEDs.
You may use either an LED strip or individual LEDs.
The LEDs or strip must be mounted securely inside of the box.

Circuit: 
The circuit must be made on an etched circuit board.
The box must include mounting hardware or brackets for the circuit board.
All external inputs (potentiometers, LEDs) 

Software:
The color of the lights must change based on an internal timing routine or external factors such as temperature or proximity.
