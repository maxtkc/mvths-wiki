SUMO ROBOT CONTEST
======================

Overview
--------

In this project you will design and build a mini sumo robot for competition. Your robot must be designed according to the following specifications which are based on the international standards for the mini class of sumo robots. 

MICROCONTROLLERS MUST USE SOCKET HEADERS TO CONNECT TO BOARD.

Requirements 
--------------

The following are a list of requirements for the design of your robot. 

- **Weight:** The total weight of your robot must not exceed 500 grams. 
- **Length and width:** The dimensions of your robot may be no more than 15 cm in length or width. A 15 cm square tube will be provided for testing the dimensions. Note: International standards are 10cm on each side.
- **Height:** There is no limit on height.
- **Logic Control:** A Metro Mini , Arduino Uno, or ATMega328P will be provided for logic control. Alternatively, you may choose to use another control platform. 
- **Circuit:** The final robot may not use a breadboard. All electronics may be soldered directly or part of a custom designed PCB.
- **Motor controller:** An MD17A motor controller module will be provided to drive the robots motors. Alternatives are allowed.
- **Motors:** The robot will use standard DC plastic geared motors. You will have a choice between two gear ratios either 120:1 or 200:1. Alternative: You may use motors after consulting with a teacher.
- **Wheels:** No wheels will be provided. These can be custom made using any material. There are CAD guides for wheels.
- **Tires:** O-rings in 2 inch or 3 inch diameters will be provided for use as tires. Alternatively, you may custom cast your own tires.
- **Battery:** The robot will be use a 7.2 Volt LiPo battery which has a capacity of 1000mAh. The robot must include a secure holder for the battery.
- **Line sensors:** Two QTR-1A photo-reflective sensors will be provided for tracking lines. Additional sensors and alternative sensors may be used. 
- **Object sensors:** One VL53L0X sensor will be provided for detecting other robots. Additional sensors and alternative sensors may be used. 
- **Start Button:** The robot must use a momentary soft latching push button for the purpose of starting the robot during a competition. This button will be provided. The robot must also include a three second delay before it starts. 
- **Cost:** The total cost for additional parts and construction of the robot must not exceed $40. Details are provided below.

Cost
----

The cost of your project will be the sum of the cost of the materials you use to create all of your parts and the cost of any additional parts you use or purchase for your project. 

Material Costs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Materials include those in your final robot as well as those you use to develop your robot. For example, if you build a wheel and do not use it, the cost of materials for that wheel will be included in your total budget. Below is a list of costs for a majority of materials. Note that for the first four items there is a 30% markup due to material waste.

Parts Cost
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
An additional part is any part used in your robot beyond the initial parts listed in the requirements section above. For example, we will provide two line sensors. If you decide to use an additional line sensor, the cost of the sensor will be added to your total budget. You may also choose to not use one of the parts in the initial list. In this case, the cost of that part can be deducted from your total budget. If you choose to use a part that is not on the list, you must provide a cost for that part and add the cost of that part to your budget.
