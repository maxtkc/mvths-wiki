Overview
---------
As you may have noticed there are two functions *void setup()* and *void loop()* in every code file you create using the Arduino IDE. Up until now you have always placed your code inside the *void setup()* function. Code inside the *void setup()* function runs exactly once after the program is started or your Metro Mini is plugged into power. Code inside *void loop()* function runs repeatedly until the Metro Mini is unplugged. 

As a reminder, in order to place code inside of either the *void setup()* or *void loop()* function, you must place your code between the open and closed curly braces for that function. Every function in C is required to have an open and close curly brace to define the contents of the function.
