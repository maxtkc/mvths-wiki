# Arrays

## Overview

Arrays provide a way to store multiple variables under a single variable name. This is very convenient for sets of variables that need to be accessed sequentially.

The following is an example of how to initialize an array. Note that the name of the array is text\_array. You can name and array anything you like, but it is good to get in the habit of naming both your variables and arrays with names that accurating describe their purpose. You are STRONGLY encouraged to review the concepts page on [arrays](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BmZbXzxnD2j17QToSZ9jeZmnP7burwfksfQq2v4zu-Y/edit%23heading%3Dh.s6da4crcmuz1&sa=D&ust=1587613174104000).

####         int text\_array\[3\] = {2, 5, 44};

### Exercise:

Write a program that includes an array with three elements. Print the first element in the array.

### Exercise:

Write a program that includes an array with four elements. Print the last element in the array.

### Exercise:

Write a program that includes an array with four elements. Print each element of the array in order. Each number should be printed on a separate line.

### Exercise:

Write a program that includes and array that holds four different numbers. Now print each element of the array in order using a [for loop](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BmZbXzxnD2j17QToSZ9jeZmnP7burwfksfQq2v4zu-Y/edit%23heading%3Dh.2u7q6orum403&sa=D&ust=1587613174106000).

### Exercise:

Write a program that includes two arrays with three elements each. Compare the first element in both arrays. If they are equal, print “equal”. If they are not equal print “not equal.”

### Exercise:

Write a program that includes two arrays with three elements each. Compare the two arrays to determine if they are identical (i.e. they have the same elements in the same order). If they are equal, print “equal”. If they are not equal print “not equal.”

### Exercise:

Repeat the exercise above, but use a for loop to compare the three elements of each array.
