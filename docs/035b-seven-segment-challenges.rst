Seven Segment Challenges
===============

Overview
--------

The four-digit seven segment display provides an easy and quick way to display numbers. It is also highly visible from a distance. Each segment can display the digits 
0-9 as well as the characters A-F. It can also be used as clock display since it contains a colon between the two pairs of digits.
