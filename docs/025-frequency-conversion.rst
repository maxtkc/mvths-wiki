Frequency Conversion
====================

Overview
--------

**Frequency** is a measurement of the speed of pulses or number of pulses over time. The unit of measurement for 
frequency is Hertz which is defined as cycles (pulses) per second. A fast CPU might have a frequency of 3Ghz. That is the processor can
run calculations at 3 billion cycles per second. By contrast the microcontroller that you are using runs at only 16Mhz, or 16 million cycles per second. 
Your home router most likely supports 2.4Ghz and 5.0Ghz or a communication wavelength of 2.4 and 5.0 billion cycles per second respectively. At the lower 
end of the spectrum, the frequency of middle C on a piano is 261.6Hz. That is the string inside of the piano is vibrating at 261.6 cycles per second resulting
in your ear hearing the note middle C.

**Period** is the measurement of the length in time of a single pulse or cycle. 



Exercise
~~~~~~~~

In the following exercise, you will use a waves frequency to determine its period and vice versa. Read the section on
`waves <https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BmZbXzxnD2j17QToSZ9jeZmnP7burwfksfQq2v4zu-Y/edit%23heading%3Dh.r3kc4sg9zrj4&sa=D&ust=1587613173942000>`__Â in
concepts to learn more about frequency conversion

Using the equation for converting frequency to period complete
the following two tables. Note that the units of Hertz are cycles per
second and as a result the equation you are using produces units of
seconds. Make sure to use CORRECT units and round to the nearest
thousandth. The table also includes a column for converting seconds to
milliseconds. You can find information about converting between
engineering units
