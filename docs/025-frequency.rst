Frequency
====================

Overview
--------

In the previous lesson you made an LED blink by turning it on and off repeatedly. The faster you turned the LED on and off the faster it blinked which
in turn means a higher frequency. The slower you turned the LED off and on, the slower the frequency. Frequency is a measurement of the number of 
blinks over a period of time. Again, more blinks represents a higher frequency.

The unit of measurement for frequency is Hertz which is defined as cycles "blinks" per second. A fast CPU might have a frequency of 3Ghz. That is the processor can
run calculations at 3 billion cycles per second. By contrast the microcontroller that you are using runs at only 16Mhz, or 16 million cycles per second.
