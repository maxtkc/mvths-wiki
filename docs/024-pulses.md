# Pulses

## Overview

Pulses are used in everything from communication signals to controlling the speed of a motor. A pulse can be created on a microcontroller by simply setting a pin HIGH and then LOW in an infinite loop.

The following shows an example of a code that creates an infinite set of pulses. To the right of the code is a diagram of the pulses showing how each line of code creates one section of the pulse.

### Exercise:

Add an LED to your board if there is not already one on there. Write a program to flash the LED using a pulse. Reduce the delay until you can no longer see that the LED is flashing. Write the value of your delay here: \_\_\_\_\_ ms. This is your CFF or critical flicker-fusion frequency. Read an article about CFF [here](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21586532-small-creatures-fast-metabolisms-see-world-action-replay-slo-mo&sa=D&ust=1587613173941000). It is pretty cool.
