For Loops
=========================

Overview
--------

In this lesson, you will create more complex waveforms and display them on your scope. A wave form is created using two delays. One for the low portion of the pulse
and the other for the high portion of the pulse. You can vary these waveforms over time by using either a for loop or potentiometer as input.
