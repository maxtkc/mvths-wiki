# Frequency Conversion

## Overview

Frequency is a primary measurement of pulses and measures the waves that pass a point over time. Frequency is often used to measure the speed of a  CPU as in a 3Ghz processor. Your home router most likely supports 2.4Ghz and 5.0Ghz. The microcontroller that you are using runs at 16Mhz. The frequency of middle C on a piano is 261.6Hz.

In the following exercise, you will convert between frequency and period. Read the section on [waves](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BmZbXzxnD2j17QToSZ9jeZmnP7burwfksfQq2v4zu-Y/edit%23heading%3Dh.r3kc4sg9zrj4&sa=D&ust=1587613173942000) in concepts to learn more about frequency conversion

### Exercise

Use the equation for conversion that you found in concepts to complete the following two tables. Note that the units of Hertz are cycles per second and as a result the equation you are using produces units of seconds. Make sure to use CORRECT units and round to the nearest thousandth. The table also includes a column for converting seconds to milliseconds. You can find information about converting between engineering units [here](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BmZbXzxnD2j17QToSZ9jeZmnP7burwfksfQq2v4zu-Y/edit%23heading%3Dh.77xfwnlk7wp2&sa=D&ust=1587613173943000).

Find the period of the wave

|           |                     |                          |
| --------- | ------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Frequency | Period (in seconds) | Period (in milliseconds) |
| 2 Hz      |                     |                          |
| 345 Hz    |                     |                          |
| 32 kHz    |                     |                          |
| 2.7 kHz   |                     |                          |
