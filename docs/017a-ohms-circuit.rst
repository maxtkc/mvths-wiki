Ohms Law with Resistors
======================

In this lesson you are going to learn about resistors in circuits and using Ohms law to calculate both current and resistance values.

**Reading resistor values:** Note that the values beginning with R are an artifact of the schematic software used to make these circuits. R2 just a label for that resistor. The value of the resistor is indicated either with an R or K at the end of the number, and this is a bit confusing. An R at the end of the number just means that this is a resistor value. So, 470R means 470 ohms. A K at the end of the number indicates engineering notation. So, 470K means 470,000 ohms.

**Common resistor values:** While you can purcahse a resistor with just about any value there are a set of commonly found values. The table below lists some of these values.
