Ohms Law
========

Overview

Ohms law describes an important relationship between voltage, current and resistance. Current is rate of flow of electrons which make your circuits work. Voltage represents a pressure moving current forward. Resistance represents an opposing pressure limiting the flow of current. In a wire you can imagine, voltage pushing current forward and resistance pushing current back. The total flow or current is proportional to the voltage and inversly proportional to the resistance. This relationship is called Ohms law and is represented as follows.


Usinng Ohm’s law you can correctly specify the proper resistor for limiting
current to any device. Most often in the shop, we are using resistors to
limit current to LEDs. Driving an LED with too low a value resistor (or no resistor) will invariably
lead to failure of the LED due to too much current. Driving an LED with
too large a value resistor will result in no light from the LED.

For each type of LED there is a maximum safe current. While you have been using LEDs as generic devices each one has an exact model number and cooresponding datasheet. The following is a
table from the datasheet for the 334-15/T1C1-4WYA which an Everlight 5mm
Round White LED (T-1 3/4).

Note that in the table above the recommended maximum current is 30ma. If
you cannot find the datasheet for an LED, it is generally safe to assume
that the maximum current is at least 15ma.

Ohm’s law describes the fundamental relationship between `voltage,
current and
resistance <https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BmZbXzxnD2j17QToSZ9jeZmnP7burwfksfQq2v4zu-Y/edit%23heading%3Dh.7g89z82u0oqw&sa=D&ust=1587613173896000>`__.
Voltage represents a pressure driving current. Resistance represents a
pressure limiting current. In other words, the ratio of voltage (V) over
resistance (R) is directly proportional to current (I) or (V/R = I).
More generally this relationship is represented at V = IR. In this
lesson, round your measurements for current to the nearest thousandth. Copy and complete the following table in your notebook.
