Ohms Law with Circuits
======================

In this lesson you are going to us Ohms law to calculate the current following in the following circuits. 

Challenge
---------
Use Ohms law to calculate the amount of current flowing in the three circuits shown below. Round your measurements for current to the nearest thousandth. Copy and complete the following table in your notebook. Note that the values beginning with R are an artifact of the schematic software used to make these circuits. R28 just a label for that resistor. The value of the resistor is indicated either with an R or K at the end of the number, and this is a bit confusing. An R at the end of the number just means that this is a resistor value. So, 470R means 470 ohms. A K at the end of the number indicates engineering notation. So, 470K means 470,000 ohms.
