Functions
======

Overview
--------

In this lesson, you will write your own function. So far, you have used many functions that were pre-written for you such as, delay(), digitalWrite(), Serial.print(), etc. You have also modified two functions (setup and loop) that are created by the IDE. One of the most powerful features of programming is the ability to write your own functions. Creating a function allows you to avoid writing the same code multiple times. For example, the delay() function involves many lines of code. If you did not have access to this function, you would need to add all these same lines of code to your code file everywhere you want to use a delay. Instead, you can just call the function with one line of code whenever you need to use it.
