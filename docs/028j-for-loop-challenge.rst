For Loop Challenge
=========================

Exercise
--------

Consider two sets of numbers. The first, 0 to 45 will be our source range. The second, 0 to 220, will be our target range. Write a program that prints these two columns of numbers in parallel. The first column should inclue the numbers 0 to 45 counting by 1. The second column should just one number for each of the numbers in the first column (46 total) but should cover the full range from 0 to 220. Obviously, this second column cannot count by 1. The second column should display a linear conversion of the first column. Refer to a previous lesson Conversion Factors for help. The following is an example of the first three pairs.

   0.00    0.00
   1.00    4.89
   2.00    9.78
