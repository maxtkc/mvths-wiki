Complete Board
==============

The following are some tips for completing your new circuit board.

#. If the traces do not seem clean, i.e. they have "hairy" copper in them, rub a Scotch Bright pad to clean it up.

#. Solder on only the parts you need to program the board. This includes the microcontroller, pullup resistor, capacitor, resonator and programming cable lead. This make sure you have elimated any mistakes on the board before going forward.

#. Test the board to make sure you can programm it.

#. Once your board is complete, use hot glue to hold
