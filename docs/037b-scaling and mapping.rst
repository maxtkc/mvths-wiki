Scaling and Mapping
==============

Overview

Scaling is a simple way of converting one range of numbers to another range. As an example, a audio sensor might be able to measure the loudness of sound from 0dB to 120dB the 
display that it is connected to might only have ten LED bars to represent loudness. In this case, 0db would correspond to no LED light bars and 120db would correspond to 120dB.

For example, if you wanted to convert the range of numbers 0 to 10 to the 
range 0 to 20, you would simply multiply the first set by 2. If the first set were represented by the variable x and the second y then if
