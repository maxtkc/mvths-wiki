Frequency Conversion
=====================

Overview
--------

Frequency and period are the inverse of each other. For example, a 3 Hertz wave would have three cycles (periods) per second. This would mean that we could measure three periods in every second. In turn, the period of the wave must be 1/3 of a second or 1 over the frequency. ::

   f = 1/T

   T = 1/f

Note that (f) is the symbol for frequency while (T) is the symbol for period.

Exercise
~~~~~~~~

#. The following wave has a frequency of 8 cycles every one second or 8 Hertz. In your notebook write the period for this wave. Make sure to use correct units.

#. Using the equations shown above for converting frequency to period and vice versa, complete the following two tables in your notebook. Note that the units of Hertz are cycles per second and as a result the equation you are using produces units of seconds. The table also includes a column for converting seconds to milliseconds. 

Find the period of the wave. Round to the nearest one millionth for seconds and make sure to include units.

+-------------+-----------------------+----------------------------+
| 2.7 kHz     |                       |                            |

Find the frequency of the wave. Round to the nearest one hundredth for frequency.
