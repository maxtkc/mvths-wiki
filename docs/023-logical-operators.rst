operators <https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BmZbXzxnD2j17QToSZ9jeZmnP7burwfksfQq2v4zu-Y/edit%23heading%3Dh.wu2vkp32zpto&sa=D&ust=1587613173940000>`__Â AND,
OR and NOT. As with relational operators, these are mostly used with
conditionals.

Exercise:
~~~~~~~~~

1. With a potentiometer and at least one LED on your board, write a
   program to turn on the LED when the value of the potentiometer is
   above 600 or below 400. Note that both of these conditions must be met for the
   LED to turn on.
   
2. Add a button on your board. If you have forgotten how to correctly add a button see the section on `inputs <https://mvths-wiki.readthedocs.io/en/latest/019-buttons.html>`__for a refresher. Write a program that turns on the LED when the value of the
   potentiometer is between 200 and 400 and the button is pressed.
