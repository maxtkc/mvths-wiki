MD17A
=============================

Overview
--------

The MD17A is a small dual motor control module made by Pololu and based on the DRV8833 motor driver IC. The following are features of this motor module. You can find more information about the module on the Pololu site `here <https://www.pololu.com/product/2130>`__. 

- Dual-H-bridge motor driver: can drive two DC motors or one bipolar stepper motor
- Operating voltage: 2.7‌‌ V to 10.8 V
- Output current: 1.2 A continuous (2 A peak) per motor
- Motor outputs can be paralleled to deliver 2.4 A continuous (4 A peak) to a single motor
- Inputs are 3V- and 5V-compatible
- Under-voltage lockout and protection against over-current and over-temperature
- Reverse-voltage protection circuit
- Current limiting can be enabled by adding sense resistors (not included)

The following is an image of the labeled side of the module and a table listed the functions of each pin.

The following is a hook up diagram for using the MD17A. Note that generally it is best to solder and use the MD17A with the label side up so it is easier to make sure your connections are correct. **VERY IMPORTANT** The MD17A only has one voltage input. This is for the power to the motor. This voltage should ONLY be applied to this pin and no where else on your board.

Exercise:
~~~~~~~~~

#. Set up your breadboard with the MD17A following the table for making connections for one motor. For this first step, do not use a microcontroller (Arduino). You will simply connect long flexible jump wires to the two input pins that correspond to the motor you connected. Setting these pins to power and ground should control your motors direction and turn it on and off.

#. Add a microcontroller (Arduino) to your breadboard and control the motor in software. 

#. Add a second motor to your circuit. Write a program to drive both motors for 3 seconds, reverse direction for 3 seconds and off for 3 seconds.
