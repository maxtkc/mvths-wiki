Conditionals
=============

Overview

--------

Conditionals offer a way for your code to make decisions. In the real world, an example of a conditional might be, if it is cold put on a sweater. A conditional in code looks like the following (see below). In the following code, the condition x == 5 is evaluated as either true or false. 

.. code-block:: c
   
   if (x == 5) {                //Checks if this condition is true (i.e. does x equal 5). Note double equals sign
       Serial.print("true");
                  //If the condition is true than any lines of code placed between the two curly braces are executed.
   }

**Important:** Note the double equals sign is used to evaluate a con.. The code x = 5 tells the program to set x to the value 5. The code x == 5 tells the program to compare the value of x and 5.

   * - Relational Operator
     - Description
     - Example
   * - ==
     - is equal to
     - x == 5
   * - >
     - is greater than
     - x > 5
   * - <
     - is less than
     - x < 5
   * - >=
     - is greater than or equal to
     - x >= 5
 
   * - <= 
     - is less than or equal to
     - x <= 5
   * - != 
     - is not equal to
     - x != 5
   

   
In addition to the single state  *if*, you can also have a second state represented by *else*. The following is an example of code that has two possible states based on the evaluation of the initial condition.

.. code-block:: c
   
   if (x == 5) {                //Checks if this condition is true (i.e. does x equal 5). 
       //If the condition is true than lines placed here are executed.
   } else {
    //If the condition is false than this lines placed here are executed.
   }
     
Challenge
----------

#. Write a program to test the value of a variable. Initialize a variable and set its initial value to 6. Using a conditional, check if the value is in fact 6. If the value is 6  then print "true" in your serial monitor.

#. Connect pin 6 to ground via a long jump wire. Modify your program to print "true" only if pin 6 is connected to power.

#. Modify your code to print "true" if pin 6 is connected to power and "false" if connected to ground.
