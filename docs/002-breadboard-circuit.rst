Breadboard Circuit
==================

Overview
--------

Breadboards provide a convenient way to connect components together to make a circuit. In the previous lesson you used your hands or maybe bent the wires to make a connection between components. The breadboard shown below has lots of holes (830 to be exact) that can be used to easily connect your components together.

Construct the above three circuits on your
`breadboard <https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BmZbXzxnD2j17QToSZ9jeZmnP7burwfksfQq2v4zu-Y/edit%23heading%3Dh.utuueb8q3cey&sa=D&ust=1587613173841000>`__.
Note that NOT all three circuits will light the LED. What is important
is that you are able to follow the schematic design correctly.
IMPORTANT: Each of the component leads should be placed in one of the
breadboard holes. No holes should have more than one lead.
