Conversion Challenge
=========================

Exercise
--------

Create two columns of numbers. The first, 0 to 45 will be your source range. The second, 0 to 220, will be your target range. Write a program that prints these two columns of numbers in parallel. The first column should inclue the numbers 0 to 45 counting by 1. The second column should include numbers from 0 to 220, but only 46 (45+1 to account for zero) total numbers. Obviously, this second column cannot count by 1. The second column should display a linear conversion of the first column. Refer to a previous lesson Conversion Factors for help. The following is an example of the first three pairs.

::

   0.00    0.00
   1.00    4.89
   2.00    9.78
