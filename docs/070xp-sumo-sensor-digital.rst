STEP ELEVEN: Sumo Digital Sensor
======================

Overview
--------

In this lesson, you will learn how to write a program to control your sensor on a digital port. 

Exercise
~~~~~~~~



**Digital**: This method relies on the internal comparator on each of the digital pins. Since you can not adjust the threshold in software you must rely on setting the correct height to get the results you want. The advantage of this method is that it is fast and can be used with interrupts.

*Exercise*: Repeat the last exercise, but move the output from an analog port to a digital port. You might need to adjust the height of your sensor so that it works correctly.
