Variables
=========

Overview
--------

Variables are placeholders used to store values that can be modified.
Just as you use x or y to represent a number in algebra, you can use
x or y as a place holder for a number in your code. This is particularly
useful if you want a number to change in your code. For example, if
you wanted to keep track of the number of times a user pressed a
button you could create a variable and call it "x" or "button" and 
store the number of times a button was pressed in that variable.

Initializing
------------

In order to use a `variable <https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BmZbXzxnD2j17QToSZ9jeZmnP7burwfksfQq2v4zu-Y/edit%23heading%3Dh.vbe1wov8lque&sa=D&ust=1587613173882000>`__ you must set up the variable so the program
knows the type and name of the variable. We call this initializing a variable. For the time 
being, you will initalize variables at the top of your code file, that is place the initialization of your variable above and 
outside of both the loop and setup functions.  

Exercise:
~~~~~~~~~

1. Initialize the variable z at the top of your code file and set its
   initial value to 9.

   <!-- end list -->

2. Print the variable to your terminal window using the following
   command::
Serial.print(z);

3. Modify your code so that the variable starts at the value 9 and
   `counts
   up <https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BmZbXzxnD2j17QToSZ9jeZmnP7burwfksfQq2v4zu-Y/edit%23heading%3Dh.j1vujjth5hql&sa=D&ust=1587613173884000>`__Â by
   one every 500 milliseconds. It should display the values in a column
   in your terminal window.

4. Modify your code so that the variable starts at the value 9 and
   counts down by one every 500 milliseconds. It should display the
   values in a column in your terminal window.

5. Modify your code so that there are two variables x and y. The
   variable x should start at 6 and count up by 2. The variable y should
   start at 50 and count down by 2. The variables should be displayed in
   two columns in your terminal window.
