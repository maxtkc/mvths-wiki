Challenge
----------
There are 64 squares on a chessboard. Imagine if you placed on grain of rice on the upper left square of a chessboard. Then you placed two grains on the square to its right and four grains on the next square and continued doubling the amount of rice until you reached the last square of the chessboard. How many grains would you have? Guess a number and write it in your notebook.

#. Write a for loop that prints the numbers from 1 to 64 in one column. 

#. Add a second column that displays the numnber of grains of rice for each corresponding square.

#. Try using different variable types. 

#. Record the highest number you can reach in your notebook along with its square.
