Simple Switch
=============

Overview
--------

In this lesson, you will use a momentary switch to turn on and off an LED. Like all switches, a momentary switch is able to complete or disconnect a circuit with the press of a button. A momentary switch is named for the fact that it is only connected (completing the circuit) when the button is pressed or momentarily. When the button is released the circuit is disconnected. Below is a picture of a momentary switch.

Note that it has four leads (or legs). This can make it **VERY** confusing to use since you only need two leads (or legs) to open and close a circuit, but which ones. Learning this now is important because it is easy to make mistakes latter on when you use these in your projects.

   Momentary Switch

Below are two diagrams from the datasheet for the momentary switch. I both diagrams you can see that pins 1 and 2 are connected and pins 3 and 4 are connected. These pairs act as single pins. It does not matter if you wire up your circuit to pin 1 or 2 since they act as the same pin. The same is true for pins 3 and 4.

Exercise:
~~~~~~~~~
#. Place your button across the middle of your breadboard. As in over the gap in the middle of your breadbaord so that two leads (legs) are on one side and two leads are on the other. 

#. Using your breadboard, complete the following circuit which uses a switch to turn on and off an LED. When placing your button on the breadboard make sure not to short the two sides, (1 and 2) and (3 and 4) by placing them in a connected row or column. NOTE: Since it is difficult to connect an alligator clip directly to the leads on the button, you should consider using a long jump wire as described in the previous unit.

#. Wire the components in a different order from the circuit shown above. The LED should still light when the button is pressed.
