STEP NINE: Sumo Analog Sensor
======================

Overview
--------

In this lesson, you will learn how to write a program to read the values from your line sensor.

Exercise
--------

#. Using the same set up from the previous lesson, connect the output pin (labeled OUT) from your reflectance sensor to an analog port on your MetroMini. Leave the multimeter attached so you can make a comparison between the voltage readings and the readings from your analog port.

#. Write a program to read the value from your analog port and print it in the serial monitor.

#. Test the sensor with the white and black test card you made in the previous lesson.

#. Next to the notes you made in your notebook in the previous lesson, record the analog value range for white and black.
