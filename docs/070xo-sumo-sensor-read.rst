STEP NINE: Sumo Analog Sensor
======================

Overview
--------

In this lesson, you will learn how to write a program to read the values from your line sensor.

Exercise
--------

#. Using the same set up from the previous lesson, connect the output pin (labeled OUT) from your reflectance sensor to an analog port on your MetroMini. Leave the multimeter attached so you can make a comparison between the voltage readings and the readings from your analog port.

#. Write a program to read the value from your analog port and print it in the serial monitor.





*Exercise*: Using the data you collected in the previous lesson for serial monitor values over black and white surfaces, write a program that displays in the terminal windowÂ the word "white" when the sensor is over a white surface and "black" when the sensor is over a black surface.
