Simple Circuit
==============

Overview
--------

In this first lesson, you will light an LED using just an LED, a resistor, test leads and your bench power supply.  This lesson is as much about lighting an LED as it is about learning to experiment and not be afraid to make mistakes. Engineering is primarily about experimenting and making lots of mistakes. In this lesson, you will not be told exactly how to make the LED light. You will

You will need the following components for this exercise. 
1) An LED
Construct the following circuit using your `bench
supply <https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BmZbXzxnD2j17QToSZ9jeZmnP7burwfksfQq2v4zu-Y/edit%23heading%3Dh.x2bqdmttrjfd&sa=D&ust=1587613173836000>`__ as
a voltage source. You will simply need to connect the
`components <https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BmZbXzxnD2j17QToSZ9jeZmnP7burwfksfQq2v4zu-Y/edit%23heading%3Dh.s6ahz6tu1kg9&sa=D&ust=1587613173836000>`__ in
the order shown below. You can connect them by touching the lead of one
component to the lead of another component or bending them to hold them
in place. You will need two `test
leads <https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BmZbXzxnD2j17QToSZ9jeZmnP7burwfksfQq2v4zu-Y/edit%23heading%3Dh.21kolzx0ntn7&sa=D&ust=1587613173836000>`__ to
connect your bench supply to your circuit.

The correct circuit will light the LED without destroying the LED. It
may take a few tries to get it right and you may need to try placing a
component in BOTH directions (i.e. flipping the direction of a component
might make the circuit work or not work.) Don’t worry about destroying
an LED. This is part of learning.

Exercise:
~~~~~~~~~

1. Change the order of the components so that the LED is directly
   connected to the 5V lead of the power supply with the resistor
   following second as shown below. Do you notice any difference in the
   function of the circuit?

2. Reverse the direction of the LED in the circuit. Does the LED still
   light? The LED should only work in one direction. Because of this
   feature, we call an LED a polarized device. Try to identify a feature
   on the LED that signifies which direction it should be facing in the
   circuit.

3. Reverse the direction of the resistor in the circuit. Does the LED
   still light? It should work in either direction. Because of this
   feature, we call a resistor a non-polarized device.
