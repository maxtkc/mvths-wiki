As you may have noted from the guide on
`breadboards <https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BmZbXzxnD2j17QToSZ9jeZmnP7burwfksfQq2v4zu-Y/edit%23heading%3Dh.utuueb8q3cey&sa=D&ust=1587613173846000>`__Â in
concepts, the two sets of long rows at the top of and bottom of your
breadboard are referred to as busses. Each bus has a red side and a blue
side. Standard practice is to connect power (the red lead from your
bench supply) to the red side of the bus and ground (the black lead from
your bench supply) to the blue side. You can use alligator clips and
long jump wires.
