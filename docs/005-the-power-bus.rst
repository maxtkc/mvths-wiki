The Power Bus
=============

Overview
--------

Connect power to your power bus and measure the voltage on your
breadboard using a multimeter.

As you may have noted from the guide on
`breadboards <https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BmZbXzxnD2j17QToSZ9jeZmnP7burwfksfQq2v4zu-Y/edit%23heading%3Dh.utuueb8q3cey&sa=D&ust=1587613173846000>`__Â in
concepts, the two sets of long rows at the top of and bottom of your
breadboard are referred to as busses. Each bus has a red side and a blue
side. Standard practice is to connect power (the red lead from your
bench supply) to the red side of the bus and ground (the black lead from
your bench supply) to the blue side. You can use alligator clips and
long jump wires.

Exercise:
~~~~~~~~~

1. Set up the board with power and ground as described above. Using a
   `multimeter <https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BmZbXzxnD2j17QToSZ9jeZmnP7burwfksfQq2v4zu-Y/edit%23heading%3Dh.sf66jio1dnm6&sa=D&ust=1587613173847000>`__,
   confirm that correct voltage is on your bus.

2. Add a couple of wires to bring power and ground to both sides of your
   board and confirm with a multimeter. One wire should connect the red
   bus on the top of your board to the red bus on the bottom. The other
   wire should connect the blue (ground) bus on the top of your 
   board to the blue (ground) bus on the bottom of your board.

3. Set up the following LED circuit on your board, but this time 
   carefully read the  `good practices <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BmZbXzxnD2j17QToSZ9jeZmnP7burwfksfQq2v4zu-Y/edit#bookmark=id.f8f0p8y93bxg>`__,
   setting up a breadboard and follow these guidelines.
