Sumo Line Detector
======================

Overview
--------

In this lesson, you will learn how to use a QTR-MD-01A Reflectance Sensor with your robot. As you noted in the previous lesson, stray light can easily affect the signal value of your sensor. In order to get an accurate reading, you will need to mount this sensor at its optimal distance from the surface you are testing. 

Exercises
---------

#. Using materials such as cardboard or chipboard, create a mount for your sensor that keeps it about 5mm from the surface of your table. You may also want to shroud it from stray light. 

# Create a test card which includes a black and white surface. This can be done with an index card and tape, but note that not all white surfaces reflect eqaully and not all black surfaces reflect equally. Check out the surface of the sumo table as a reference.

#. Using your new set up, record voltage values in your notebook for the black and white surfaces.

   - White surface: ______
   
   - Black surface: ______
   
#. Now connect the output from your sensor to an analog port on your microcontroller. 

#. Write a program to display these values on your serial monitor.

#. Repeat the test above and record the values in your notebook from your serial monitor.

   - White surface: ______
   
   - Black surface: ______
