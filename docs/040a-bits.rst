What is a bit?
--------------
A bit is the most basic unit of information in computing and digital communications. The name is a portmanteau of binary digit. The bit represents a logical state with one of two possible values. These values are most commonly represented as either "1" or "0", but other representations such as true/false are also widely used.

Why use bits?
-------------
The answer is not simple, but has to do with practicality of electronics. The primary electrical block of all digital systems is the transistor. Checking if a state of a transistor, (is it on or off) can be done fairly easily and reliably. In order to build systems with more states for example three states, it would be necessary to accurately determine a state between on and off.
