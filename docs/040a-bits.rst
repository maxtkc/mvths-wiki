Binary
======

Overview
--------

Binary is a way of represent numbers with only two digits (0 and 1). It is also known as base-2 because it only has two digits. Numbers can be represented in any number base from 2 and up. Common number bases in programming include base-2 (binary), base-10 (decimal) and base-16 (hex). Decimal or base-10 because it includes 10 digits (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) is what humans generally use for our everyday exchange of numbers. 

Since computers (and microcontrollers) are only capable of storing information in one of two states, all information from a simple number to a full-length video is stored in binary on computers. Though we mostly write numbers in decimal in our code, it is sometimes more convenient to use binary or hexadecimal. We will discuss hexadecimal in a later lesson. Below is table showing all three.
