Variable Types
==============

Overview
--------

So far you have initialized all of your variables as int.

int x;
int counter = 9;

Potentiometers are another common form of input for controlling an
electronic device. They generally come in two forms: dials and sliders.
Dials are commonly used to control the volume on an audio device or
temperature on a thermostat. Sliders are commonly used in joysticks to
convert the motion of the joystick into signals that can be used by a
digital microcontroller.

Potentiometer Design
--------------------

All potentiometers have three leads as shown in the diagram below. The
two outside leads (A and B) form a fixed value resistor (i.e. the value
