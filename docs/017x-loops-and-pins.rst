Loops and Pins
===========

Overview
--------

In this lesson, you will use a *for loop* to control your LEDs. This is an example of how you can use the variable in your loop for more than just counting.

Exercise
---------
#. Add four LEDs to your breadboard on pins 3, 4, 5, 6.

#. Create a for loop that counts from 3 to 6. 

#. Use the variable in your for loop to set the pins 3, 4, 5, 6 as output pins.

#. Use the variable in your for loop to turn on the LEDs on pins 3, 4, 5, 6. 

   TEACHER CHECK

#. Add a delay in your for loop, so that the LEDs appear to turn on in sequence as in 3, then 4, etc.

#. Add a second for loop to your code to turn off the LEDs including a delay so that they they appear to turn off in the opposite sequence, 6, then 5, etc.
