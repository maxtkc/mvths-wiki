Testing Continuity
===================

Overview
--------

In this lesson, you will use a multimeter to test the continuity of the button. If two points in a a circuit are continuous, there is a direct electrical connection between the two points. For example, the two pairs of pins on the button are continuous when the button is pressed.


Setting up the Mulitmeter
-------------------------

You will need to collect a mulitmeter and a pair of cables with aligator clips as shown below.

#. To confirm that you have set everything up correctly, touch the two ends (alligators) together. You should hear a beep. This indicates continuity.

#. Using the breadboard you set up in the previous lesson with the button, connect the multimeter leads to the button on the breadboard using jumpwires. If you set up is correct, the meter should beep when the button on your breadboard is pressed.
