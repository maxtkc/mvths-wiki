Breadboard Conventions
=============

Overview
--------

The following are good conventions for setting up your breadboard and adding components.

#. Connect the two power buses and connect the two ground buses. As mentioned in the previous lesson, the two ground buses (and the two power buses) are not connected inside the breadboard. In order to connect these two buses you must use jump wires as shown below. IMPORTANT: Make sure only power to power and ground to ground. Do not cross connect these buses.

#. Use short orange and yellow jump wires for all connections to the power and ground buses. Using these wires will make your board less cluttered and will make it very easy to identify which pins and leads are connected to power and ground. Below is an image showing an integrated circuit and potentiometer both with connections to power and ground.

#. Cut the leads on compoents with long lead so that they sit snug against the breadboard. Resistors, LEDs and capacitors are shipped with very long leads which can get very messy on your breadboard and potentially cause short circuits. The photo below shows to contrasting circuits. The one on the left is neat and reliable. The one of the left is likely to cause problems in your circuit.

#. Place buttons across the center of the breadboard as shown below. This will make your design neater and avoid short circuits.

Exercise:
~~~~~~~~~

Light an LED on your breadboard following the recommendations above. If you want to can just copy the LED circuit design above.
