Voltage Dividers N
================

Overview
--------

Voltage dividers are use commonly used as way produce a specific voltage between two voltages. Voltage dividers are also commonly used resistance-based sensors.

Voltage dividers are designed simply using two resistors in parallel as shown in the diagrams below. The point between the two resistors is where the voltage is divided. 
Depending on the value of the resistors, the voltage will be somewhere between the high voltage in your circuit (in your case 5V) and the low voltage (0V). 
For example, if you wanted to create a voltage half way (2.5V) between 0 and 5 volts you could use two resistors of equal value and tap the point between the two resistors.

As you learned in a previous lesson, there is a voltage drop across any resistor in a circuit. You can calculate this voltage drop using the formula V=IR and by 
measuring the voltage drop with your multimeter. In the example circuits below there are two resistors and therefor two voltage drops. The total of the two voltage drops
must equal the total voltage or 5 volts. 

For the examples below, use Ohms law to determine the voltage at the point between each of the two resistors. The first step is to use Ohms law to determine the current 
flowing through each of the circuits. Remember current anywhere in a parallel circuit is the same. Also note that the total resistance of each of these circuits
is the total of the two resistors in that circuit. Once you have the current flowing in the circuit, you can use Ohms law to determine the voltage drop across each 
resistor. If you need a refresher refer to the lesson on Ohms Law and the les
on Resistors and LEDs.
