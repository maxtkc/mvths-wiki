Voltage Dividers N
================

Overview
--------

Voltage dividers are use commonly used as way produce a specific voltage between two voltages. Voltage dividers are also commonly used resistance-based sensors.

Voltage dividers are designed simply using two resistors in parallel as shown in the diagrams below. The point between the two resistors is where the voltage is divided. 
Depending on the value of the resistors, the voltage will be somewhere between the high voltage in your circuit (in your case 5V) and the low voltage (0V). 
For example, if you wanted to create a voltage half way (2.5V) between 0 and 5 volts you could use two resistors of equal value and tap the point between the two resistors.

As you learned in a previous lesson, there is a voltage drop across any resistor in a circuit. You can calculate this voltage drop using the formula V=IR and by 
measuring the voltage drop with your multimeter.


For the examples below, find the voltage at point A. More information
