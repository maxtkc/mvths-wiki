Period
====================

Overview
--------

The unit of measurement for frequency is Hertz which is defined as cycles "blinks" per second. A fast CPU might have a frequency of 3Ghz. That is the processor can
run calculations at 3 billion cycles per second. By contrast the microcontroller that you are using runs at only 16Mhz, or 16 million cycles per second.

In the following exercise

In the following exercise, you will use a waves frequency to determine its period and vice versa. Read the section on

concepts to learn more about frequency conversion

Using the equation for converting frequency to period complete
the following two tables. Note that the units of Hertz are cycles per
second and as a result the equation you are using produces units of
seconds. Make sure to use CORRECT units and round to the nearest
thousandth. The table also includes a column for converting seconds to
milliseconds. You can find information about converting between
engineering units
