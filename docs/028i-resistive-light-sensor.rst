Resistive Light Sensor
==============

Overview
--------

In this lesson you will be measuring the light level in the room using a
photocell. A photocell is a resistor that varies the value of its
resistance based on the level of light that strikes its surface.

4. Connect the output of the light sensor circuit to one of the analog pins on your
   Metro Mini.
5. Write a program to read the value of the output and print it in the
   Serial Monitor in a single column.
6. Note the changes in values in different light levels.
