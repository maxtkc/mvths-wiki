Microsecond Delays
==========================

Overview
--------

In addition to the standard delay function which is measured in milliseconds, there is also a microsecond delay measured in, you guessed it, microseconds.

.. code-block:: c

  delayMicroseconds(300);

For every millisecond there are 1000 microseconds, or one millisecond equals one thousand microseconds. This correlates with the two engineering prefixes of milli and micro. 
you can find more on this in the lesson on engineering notation.
