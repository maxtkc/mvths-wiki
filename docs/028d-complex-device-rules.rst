Complex Device Rules
==========================

Overview
--------


1. Always remove power from your board when setting up a complex device. This is generally a good idea when adding any component to your breadboard, but very important
   when adding a complex device. These devices cost more than individual components and can be damaged more easily. The easiest way to remove power from your board
   is to unplug the USB.
   
2. Carefully connect the device to your circuit following the schematic and instructions provided.

3. MOST IMPORTANT: Make sure the power and ground are attached correctly. Reversing these two connections is the number one reason for damaging and complex device.

4. Apply power to your board. If you see smoke or it gets hot, remove power immediately.
