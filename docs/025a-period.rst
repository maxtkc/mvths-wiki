Period
====================

Overview
--------

As mentioned in the previous secton, the unit of measurement for frequency is Hertz which is defined as 
cycles (or periods) per second. One cycle (or period) is measured as one HIGH pulse and one LOW pulse or smallest section of a wave that could be
repeated to make the entire wave.

While a waves frequency is measured in Hertz (cycles/second), a waves period is measured in seconds. The period is the length of a 
cycle in seconds. For example, if you created a wave with a HIGH of 10 ms and a LOW of 10 ms, the period of this wave would be
20 ms or .02 seconds. 

| **Converting between frequency and period**
Frequency and period are the inverse of each other. For example, if a wave had a speed of three cycles (periods) per second that would mean that we could measure three
periods in every second. So clearly, the period of the wave is 1/3 of a second or 1 over the frequency. 

f = 1/T

T = 1/f

Note that (f) is the symbol for frequency while (T) is the symbol for period.

Exercise
~~~~~~~~

1. The following wave has a frequency of 8 cycles every one second or 8 Hertz. In your notebook write the period for this wave. Make sure to use correct units.

2. Using the equations shown above for converting frequency to period and vice versa, complete
   the following two tables in your notebook. Note that the units of Hertz are cycles per
   second and as a result the equation you are using produces units of
   seconds. Make sure to use CORRECT units and round to the nearest
   thousandth. The table also includes a column for converting seconds to
   milliseconds. You can find information about converting between
   engineering units
