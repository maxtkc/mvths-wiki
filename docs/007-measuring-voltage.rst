Measuring Voltage
=================

Overview
--------

Being able to measure voltage is extremely helpful for troubleshooting a
circuit. A voltage level can indicate if a circuit is correctly powered.
A voltage level can also indicate if a logic level is correct.

Exercise:
~~~~~~~~~

Construct a simple LED circuit on your breadboard with one resistor and
one LED. Use your
`multimeter <https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BmZbXzxnD2j17QToSZ9jeZmnP7burwfksfQq2v4zu-Y/edit%23heading%3Dh.sf66jio1dnm6&sa=D&ust=1587613173850000>`__ to
`measure the

the resistor and the LED in your simple circuit and write the results
below. If you do not know how to use a multimeter please click on the

Exercise:
~~~~~~~~~

Note that the total voltage across the entire circuit should equal the
voltage of each of the parts. Add up the voltages you measured across
the resistor and the LED. How does this compare with the voltage you
measured for the entire circuit.

Voltage across resistor \_\_\_\_  + voltage across LED \_\_\_ = Voltage
