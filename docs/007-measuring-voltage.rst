Measuring Voltage
=================

Overview
--------

All electronic circuits require a specific voltage level. Being able to measure voltage is critical to make sure your circuit is working properly. The best way to measure voltage is using a multimeter shown below.

In the image above, you can see the multimeter correctly set up for measuring voltage. The following are the steps required for this configuration.

#. Connect the red test lead to the right most port. 

#. Connect the black test lead to the middle (COM) port. 

#. Turn the dial to Vdc.

#. Press the range button so that the decimal point is in the middle of the four digits.

Voltage can be measured between any two points on your circuit using the two test leads. In the diagram below, the two leads are being used to measure the voltage across the resistor in the circuit.

Construct a simple LED circuit on your breadboard with one resistor and
one LED. Use your

the resistor and the voltage across the LED in your simple circuit. Copy the 
items listed below into your notebook and complete. If you do not know how to use a multimeter please click on the

Exercise:
~~~~~~~~~

Note that the total voltage across the entire circuit should equal the
voltage of each of the parts. Add up the voltages you measured across
the resistor and the LED. How does this compare with the voltage you
measured for the entire circuit. Write and complete the following equation into your notebook.

Voltage across resistor \_\_\_\_  + voltage across LED \_\_\_ = Voltage
across entire circuit  \_\_\_\_
