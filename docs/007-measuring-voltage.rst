Measuring Voltage
=================

Overview
--------

All electronic circuits require a specific voltage level. Being able to measure voltage is critical to make sure your circuit is working properly. The best way to measure voltage is using a multimeter shown below.

In the image above, you can see the multimeter correctly set up for measuring voltage. The following are the steps required for this configuration.

#. Connect the red test lead to the right most port. 

#. Connect the black test lead to the middle (COM) port. 

#. Turn the dial to Vdc.

#. Press the range button so that the decimal point is in the middle of the four digits.

Voltage can be measured between any two points on your circuit using the two test leads. In the diagram below, the two leads are being used to measure the voltage across the resistor in the circuit.

It is important to make sure your leads are touching metal in your circuit. As you can see in the images below, you can use the metal component leads for measureing voltage.

Exercise:
~~~~~~~~~

#. Construct a simple LED circuit on your breadboard with one resistor and one LED. Use your multimeter to measure the voltage across the resistor, the voltage across the LED, and the voltage across the entire circuit. Record these measurements in your notebook. 

   Voltage across resistor:         \_\_\_\_\_\_

   Voltage across LED:              \_\_\_\_\_\_

   Voltage across entire circuit:   \_\_\_\_\_\_

   TEACHER CHECK \_\_\_\_\_

#. Note that the total voltage across the entire circuit should equal the voltage of each of the parts. Add up the voltages you measured across the resistor and the LED. How does this compare with the voltage you measured for the entire circuit? Recorde the following equation into your notebook.

   Voltage across resistor \_\_\_\_  + voltage across LED \_\_\_ = Voltage
   across entire circuit  \_\_\_\_
