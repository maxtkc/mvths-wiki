Neopixel Challenge Two
==============

Overview
--------

From your previous circuit add a potentiometer connected to one of your analog ports. Modify your code so that a potentiometer can be used to control the number of neopixels that are lit on the neopixel strip. The more you turn the dial, the more LEDs are lit. Note that your analog input ranges from 0 to 1023 but you only have 8 neopixels (numbered 0 to 7) so you will need to create a conversion factor (see lesson on this topic for help). Below is an example.
