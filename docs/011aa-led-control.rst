Programming Leds
================

Overview
--------

LEDs are a good example of the kinds of devices you can drive with a microcontroller. LEDs also provide an easy way to indicate if a microcontroller pin is set to HIGH or LOW. **IMPORTANT:** You **MUST** to a resistor in series with any LED to prevent the LED from burning out. Driving too much current through and LED will damage the LED and potentially the microcontroller.
