LED Control
================

Overview
--------

In this lesson, we are going to go back to controlling an LED without a microcontroller. The point is gain a better understanding of both microcontrollers and LEDs, specifically the idea that a microcontroller is simply setting its pins to 0V and 5V when controlling an LED, and that an LED can be turned on by either 0V or 5V.

Exercise:
~~~~~~~~~

#. Disconnect the wire connecting the LED from your microcontroller and connect the wire to ground. The LED should not light.

#. Connect the wire from the LED to power. The LED should light.

#. **Challenge:** Reconfigure the LED circuit so that it turns on when you connect a wire to ground and turns off when you connect it to power.
