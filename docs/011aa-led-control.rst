LED Control
================

Overview
--------

In this lesson, we are going to go back to controlling an LED without a microcontroller. The point is gain a better understanding of both microcontrollers and LEDs, specifically the idea that a microcontroller is simply setting its pins to 0V and 5V when controlling an LED. And that an LED can be turn on by either 0V or 5V.
