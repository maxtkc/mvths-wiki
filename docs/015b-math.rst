Overview
--------

It is possible to perform most mathematical operations in your code. The most common operations are addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of variables. The following are some examples.

.. code-block:: c

 x = x + 1;		//adds 1 to x
 z = z - 9;		//subtracts 9 from x
 y = y * 4;		//multiplies x by 4
 x = x / 7;		//divides x by 7
