### Challenge:

1.  Set up a circuit that uses a [for loop](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BmZbXzxnD2j17QToSZ9jeZmnP7burwfksfQq2v4zu-Y/edit%23heading%3Dh.2u7q6orum403&sa=D&ust=1587613173962000)Â to change the value of the tone. This will work best if you do not use the duration feature of the tone function, but use a delay after the tone function in your loop.

2.  Modify your code so that instead of changing the frequency of the tone, the duration of the tone is changed during the for loop.

3.  Set up a circuit in which you can control the frequency of the tone produced by a piezo speaker using a potentiometer. When you turn the potentiometer one direction the tone should increase. When you turn the potentiometer the other direction, the tone should decrease.

4.  Set up a circuit that can play three different tones based on which button you press. Each button should play a different tone.
