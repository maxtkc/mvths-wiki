Generally, we print numbers in decimal (i.e. using the digits 0-9), but you can also print numbers as bits (or binary) and as they are reprGenerally, we print numbers in decimal (i.e. using the digits 0-9), but you can also print numbers as bits (or binary) and as they are represented in bits inside your controller. This can be done by adding the define BIN to your print statement as shown below.

.. code-block:: c

  Serial.println(x, BIN);    

Exercise
---------

#. Write a program that prints a column of numbers starting at zero incrementing by one. Make sure to include a short delay. 

#. Now change your print statement to print in bits or binary. Notice that the number is represented in zeros and ones. In a later lesson, we will show you how to convert numbers in binary format to decimal. What is important to note at this point is how my digits (1s or 0s) are represented on a single line.
