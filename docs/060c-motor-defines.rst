Motor Defines
=================================

Overview
--------

As you learned in an earlier lesson, defines make your code much easier to read. Given the potential complexity of your sumo code, I strongly recommend beginning with defines. If you need to, you can revisit the lesson on `defines. <https://mvths-wiki.readthedocs.io/en/latest/042cc-defines.html>`_

Exercise:
~~~~~~~~~

Write appropriate defines for each of the four pins you are using to control your two motors.
