STEP FOUR: Adding Neopixel to Breadboard Arduino
==========================

Overview
--------

In this lesson you will add a neopixel stick to your breadboard Arduino. Your final lightbox will not use a neopixel stick but will use a section of an LED light strip like the kind people put up in their rooms. These LED light strips use the exact same LEDs, specifically neopixels, that are used in the neopixel strip. Soldering the connections to LED light strips can be difficult so we will start with using the neopixel strips for testing.
