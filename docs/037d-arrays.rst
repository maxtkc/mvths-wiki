Arrays
======

Overview
--------

Arrays provide a way to store multiple variables under a single variable name. This is very convenient for sets of variables that need to be accessed sequentially.

The following is an example of how to initialize an array. Similar to initializing a variable, you need to give the array a type. In the example below the array type is int. 
also, as with variables, you also need to give the array a name. In the case below, the name of the array is example, but just like variables, you can give it any name you want.  The number in the square braces determines the size of the array or how many items it can hold. The array below can hold three items or more specifically three ints. Inside the curly braces are listed the items in the array.

  int example[3] = {2, 5, 44};

Write a program that includes an array with four elements. Print each
element of the array in order. Each number should be printed on a
separate line.

Exercise:
~~~~~~~~~

Write a program that includes and array that holds four different
numbers. Now print each element of the array in order using a `for
loop <https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BmZbXzxnD2j17QToSZ9jeZmnP7burwfksfQq2v4zu-Y/edit%23heading%3Dh.2u7q6orum403&sa=D&ust=1587613174106000>`__.

Exercise:
~~~~~~~~~

Write a program that includes two arrays with three elements each.
Compare the first element in both arrays. If they are equal, print
“equal”. If they are not equal print “not equal.”

Exercise:
~~~~~~~~~

Write a program that includes two arrays with three elements each.
Compare the two arrays to determine if they are identical (i.e. they
have the same elements in the same order). If they are equal, print
“equal”. If they are not equal print “not equal.”

elements of each array.
