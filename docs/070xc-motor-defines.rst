Sumo Motor Defines
=================================

Overview
--------

As you learned in an earlier lesson, defines make your code much easier to read. Given the potential complexity of your sumo code, I strongly recommend beginning with defines. If you need to, you can revisit the lesson on `defines. <https://mvths-wiki.readthedocs.io/en/latest/042cc-defines.html>`_

Exercise:
~~~~~~~~~

#. Determine appropriate defines for each of the four pins you are using to control your two motors. Be as descriptive as possible. For example, if pin 3 is one of two pins that controls the motor on the left side of your robot, you might use the define RIGHT_MOTOR_A for pin 2. Note: By convention, all defines should be written in all caps.

#. Place the defines at the top of your code.

#. Write defines for any other constant value you use in your code.
