Autodesk Eagle
====================

Overview
--------

While breadboards are good for initial prototyping of an electronic circuit, they are terrible for any sort of permanent design due to loose wires and poor connections. Using the instructions linked below, you will learn how to design and fabricate your own circuit boards using Autodesk Eagle CAD.

This first link is to a YouTube video created by Autodesk and describing to create a schematic and then a circuit board.

This second link is to a video describing how to create your own parts in your own custom library. 

#. When searching for parts you might need to use just part of the name suggested. For example, LED5MM might not bring up any results, but LED will.

#. Don't worry about getting the exact part for this lesson. It will be a useful lesson (and will work) even if you don't have the exact part as described in the tutorial.
#. You might need to add the Sparkfun Connectors library and find the two pin connector in there.
