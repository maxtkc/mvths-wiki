Autodesk Eagle
====================

Overview
--------

While breadboards are good for initial prototyping of an electronic circuit, they are terrible for any sort of permanent design due to loose wires and poor connections. Using the instructions linked below, you will learn how to design and fabricate your own circuit boards using Fusion 360 Eagle.

The following is a link Kevin McAleer who describes the entire process. This be all the instructions you need to build a circuit board. Note that the video begins with constructing a part in Fusion 360 to use as basis for the board outline.

This is an addition link is to a YouTube video created by Autodesk and describing to create a schematic and then a circuit board.

This second additional link is to a video describing how to create your own parts in your own custom library.
