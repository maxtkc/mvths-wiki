Autodesk Eagle
====================

Overview
--------

While breadboards are good for initial prototyping of an electronic circuit, they are terrible for any sort of permanent design due to loose wires and poor connections. Using the instructions linked below, you will learn how to design and fabricate your own circuit boards using Autodesk Eagle CAD.

This first link is to a YouTube video created by Autodesk and describing to create a schematic and then a circuit board.
