Measuring Current
=================

Overview
--------

Being able to measure current is extremely helpful for troubleshooting a
circuit.

Exercise:
~~~~~~~~~

Construct the simple LED circuits described below on your breadboard
with one resistor and one LED. Use your
`multimeter <https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BmZbXzxnD2j17QToSZ9jeZmnP7burwfksfQq2v4zu-Y/edit%23heading%3Dh.sf66jio1dnm6&sa=D&ust=1587613174592000>`__ to
`measure the
current <https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BmZbXzxnD2j17QToSZ9jeZmnP7burwfksfQq2v4zu-Y/edit%23heading%3Dh.qr0iv7e99jht&sa=D&ust=1587613174593000>`__ in
your simple circuit and write the results below. If you do not know how
to use a multimeter please click on the link above for more information.
Note that the current in a series circuit is the same throughout the
circuit, so you can measure the current between any two points.

1. Create a circuit with one 330R resistor, one LED and set the voltage
   to 6V.

Current:                         \_\_\_\_\_

2. Create a circuit with one 1K resistor, one LED and set the voltage to
   6V.

Current:                         \_\_\_\_\_
