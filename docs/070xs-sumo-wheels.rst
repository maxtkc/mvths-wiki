STEP FOURTEEN: Prototype Wheels
======================

Overview
--------

The first step in creating the protype robot is designing and printing a set of wheels. The wheels can be of any dimension as long as they can fit within the overall dimensions of the sumo bot. In order to give your wheels some traction you will likely want to use tires on your wheels. There are many possiblities for tires but the easiest is to use one of two sized o-rings provided by your teacher. 

In addition to designing the overall wheel, you will need to design a mount where your wheel will attach to your motor. You may want to design and print this part seperately to save time creating a perfect match with the 3D printer.
