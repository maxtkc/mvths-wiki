Switch State
=========

Overview
--------

A switch statement in C is an alternative from of the a conditional i.e. *if then*. Switch serves the same purpose as *if then* but in a format that is sometimes more readable. Often code built around a switch statement is called a state machine because the the switch statement allows you to switch between different states in your code.
