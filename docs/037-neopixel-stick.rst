Neopixel Stick
==============

Overview
--------

The neopixel stick is a rigid strip of eight neopixels. Neopixels are addressable LEDs that can display any one of over 16 million colors. Each neopixel includes one red, one green and one blue LED that can each display 255 shades of color. Multiplying 255 (shades of red) by 255 (shades of blue) by 255 (shades of green) gives you a total of 16,777,216 possible colors! These are the same LEDs that are in long colored LED strips, and can be controlled with the same code.
