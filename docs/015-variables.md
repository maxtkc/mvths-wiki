# Variables

## Overview

Variables are placeholders used to store values that can be modified.

# Initializing

In order to use a variable you must first initialize it. Initially you will do this at the top of your code file outside of both the loop and setup functions. This will make the variable available everywhere in your code or globally. Check out Lessons for more information about [variables](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BmZbXzxnD2j17QToSZ9jeZmnP7burwfksfQq2v4zu-Y/edit%23heading%3Dh.vbe1wov8lque&sa=D&ust=1587613173882000).

### Exercise:

1.  Initialize the variable z at the top of your code file and set its initial value to 9.

<!-- end list -->

2.  Print the variable to your terminal window using the following command.

Serial.print(z);

3.  Modify your code so that the variable starts at the value 9 and [counts up](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BmZbXzxnD2j17QToSZ9jeZmnP7burwfksfQq2v4zu-Y/edit%23heading%3Dh.j1vujjth5hql&sa=D&ust=1587613173884000)Â by one every 500 milliseconds. It should display the values in a column in your terminal window.

4.  Modify your code so that the variable starts at the value 9 and counts down by one every 500 milliseconds. It should display the values in a column in your terminal window.

5.  Modify your code so that there are two variables x and y. The variable x should start at 6 and count up by 2. The variable y should start at 50 and count down by 2. The variables should be displayed in two columns in your terminal window.
