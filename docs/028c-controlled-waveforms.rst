Controlled Waveforms 
=========================

Overview
--------

In this lesson, you will use the input from a potentiometer to control a waveform. 

Exercise:
~~~~~~~~~

#. Set up your board as required by the previous lesson with a piezo speaker and a potentiometer for volume control.

#. Add a second potentiometer to your board. Set it up in the conventional manner as voltage divider providing input to an analog port on your microcontroller.

#. Modify your code from the previous section so that value from the potentiometer controls one of the delays in your pulse code.

#. Display the pulse on your scope and play the sound on your piezo speaker.
