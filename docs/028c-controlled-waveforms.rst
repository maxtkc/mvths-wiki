Controlled Waveforms N
=========================

Overview
--------

In this lesson, you will use the input from a potentiometer to control a waveform. 

Exercise:
~~~~~~~~~

1. Set up your board as required by the previous lesson with a piezo speaker and a potentiometer for volume control.

2. Add a second potentiometer to your board. Set it up in the conventional manner as voltage divider providing input to an analog port on your microcontroller.

3. Modify your code from the previous section so that value from the potentiometer controls one of the delays in your pulse code.

4. Display the pulse on your scope and play the sound on your piezo speaker.
