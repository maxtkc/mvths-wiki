The Loop Function
=================

Overview
---------
As you may have noticed there are two functions (setup() and loop()) in every code file you create using the Arduino IDE. Up until now you have always placed your code inside the setup() function. 

Exercise:
~~~~~~~~~

Repeat the steps above for sending the word "cat" to your terminal window
but instead of placing your Serial.print() command in the setup function, 
place it in the loop function. IMPORTANT: Make sure to add a delay of at 
least 100ms to your loop function. This will ensure that the program does 
not try to send data too quickly to the serial port and CRASH
the Arduino IDE.
