The Loop Function
------------

Overview
---------
You can use the loop function to send data repeatedly to the terminal
window.

Exercise:
~~~~~~~~~

Repeat the steps above for sending the word "cat" to your terminal window
but instead of placing your Serial.print() command in the setup function, 
place it in the loop function. IMPORTANT: Make sure to add a delay of at 
least 100ms to your loop function. This will ensure that the program does 
not try to send data too quickly to the serial port and CRASH
the Arduino IDE.
