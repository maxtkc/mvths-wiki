Delays
================

Overview
--------

Delays are used in code to freeze the state of the controller for a
specified amount of time. The delay function we are using is measured in
milliseconds and has a
`range <https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BmZbXzxnD2j17QToSZ9jeZmnP7burwfksfQq2v4zu-Y/edit%23heading%3Dh.7lc2dw9cimru&sa=D&ust=1587613173867000>`__
from 0 to 10,000 milliseconds.

Below is an example of the delay command. In this example, the delay is
set for 1500 milliseconds (or 1.5 seconds).

        delay(1500);

Code
----

1. Write a program to turn your LED on and off and on again. The program
   should turn your LED on for two seconds and then off for one second
   and then back on. This code should again be placed in your setup
   function.

IMPORTANT: Do not forget to make sure to set the pin the LED is using to
an output.
