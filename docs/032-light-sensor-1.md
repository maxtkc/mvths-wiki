# Light Sensor 1

## Overview

In this lesson you will be measuring the light level in the room using a photocell. A photocell is a resistor that varies the value of its resistance based on the level of light that strikes its surface.

### Exercise:

1.  Construct the circuit shown above.
2.  Measure the voltage at the output using a multimeter.
3.  Record voltages when the photocell is:

<!-- end list -->

1.  Uncovered:                         

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ V

2.  Covered with your thumb:         

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ V

4.  Record the voltage levels for the photocell covered by the following parts of your hand. Make sure to fully cover the sensor with finger, hand or arm.

<!-- end list -->

1.  Pinky finger:                 \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Volts
2.  Pointer finger:                 \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Volts
3.  Thumb:                \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Volts
4.  Whole hand:                \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Volts
5.  Arm:                        \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Volts

What would account for the different voltages and light levels?

### Exercise:

1.  Connect the output of the circuit to one of the analog pins on your Metro Mini.
2.  Write a program to read the value of the output and print it in the Serial Monitor in a single column.
3.  Note the changes in values in different light levels.
