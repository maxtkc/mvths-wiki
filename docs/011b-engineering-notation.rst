Engineering Notation
=========

Overview
--------
Engineering notation provides a way to easily talk about very big and very small numbers. For example, instead of saying your computer runs at
2,800,000,000 Hertz, you can say it runs at 2.8 gigahertz. At the other end of the spectrum, instead of saying the wavelength of red light is .000000620 meters,
you can say it is 620 nanometers. 

The following is a table of the engineering prefixes that you are most likely to use in this class.
