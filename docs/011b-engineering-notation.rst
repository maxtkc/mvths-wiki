Engineering Notation
=========

Overview
--------
Engineering notation provides a way to easily talk about very big and very small numbers. For example, instead of saying your computer runs at
2,800,000,000 Hertz, you can say it runs at 2.8 gigahertz. At the other end of the spectrum, instead of saying the wavelength of red light is .000000620 meters,
you can say it is 620 nanometers. 

| **The Units**
Below is a table that includes a range of engineering prefixes that you are likely to need in your work.

| **Unit Conversions**
In order to convert from one unit to another, you need to move the decimal place to the right or left. Below are some examples. 

| 3Kg 	= 	3000g
| 5ms 	= 	.005s
| 34uV	= 	.034mV
| 23Mc	=	23000Kc

Challenge
---------

Convert the following to the specified units. Place your answers in your notebook. As always, make sure to include units when you write any number.

| 26ms to seconds
| 4.5Khz to Hertz
| .003s to milliseconds
| 2.34mv to Volts
