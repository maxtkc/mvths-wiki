Bits and Bytes
==============

Overview
--------
In this lesson, you will learn a little bit, no pun intended, about how information is stored on your microcontroller and computers in general. The microcontroller on your Arduino Uno or your Metro Mini are both use an 8-bit architecture. By comparison, a modern Intel processor using 64-bit architecture. A bit refers to the smallest amount of data that can be stored on a processor. A bit is represented by a single transistor and can have only two possible states, on or off. Mathematically, we refer to these states as 1 and 0 respectively. 


At the most basic level, computers store only numbers. All images, colors, lines, letters and punctuation are all represented by numbers. In this lesson you are going to learn how to print letters and punctuation from the ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) character set. The ASCII character set was established way back in 1961 as a way to represent a full set of english alphabet and punctuation in just eight bits. 

The basic character set is represented by the  or ASCII table (shown below). This table was first established in 1961 and still represents a useful standard for characters.
