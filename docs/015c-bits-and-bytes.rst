Bits and Bytes
==============

Overview
--------
In this lesson, you will learn a little bit, no pun intended, about how information is stored on your microcontroller and computers in general. The microcontroller on your Arduino Uno or your Metro Mini both use an 8-bit architecture. By comparison, a modern Intel processor uses a 64-bit architecture. A bit refers to the smallest amount of data that can be stored on a processor. A bit is represented by a single transistor and can have only two possible states, on or off. Mathematically, we refer to these states as 1 and 0 respectively. To be clear, your microcontroller can store more than 8 bits of information, but it can only store 8 bits at a time, whereas the Intel processor can store 64 bits at a time. 

A byte is simply 8 bits. There are a number of stories about the origin of this term but my favorite and possibly most likely, is that a bite is bigger than a bit, but the spelling of bite would lead to confusion, so it was changed to byte. Its size can be remembered by thinking of byte as by-eight. Why data is measured in increments of 8 also seems to be under debate, but it may have been that some early computers used eight lines for communication. There also exists a nibble. A much less used term that refers to 4 bits.
