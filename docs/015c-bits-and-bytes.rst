Printing Characters
==============

Overview
--------

At the most basic level, computers store only numbers. All images, colors, lines, letters and punctuation are all represented by numbers. In this lesson you are going to learn how to print letters and punctuation from the ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) character set. The ASCII character set was established way back in 1961 as a way to represent a full set of english alphabet and punctuation in just eight bits. 

The basic character set is represented by the  or ASCII table (shown below). This table was first established in 1961 and still represents a useful standard for characters.
