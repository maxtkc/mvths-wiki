Metro Mini And Breadboard
=========================

Overview
--------

In order to do something more interesting with your Metro Mini, you will need to connect it to a breadboard.

Power and Ground
----------------

IMPORTANT: The Metro Mini you will be using has soldered pins unlike the one in the photos below.

As mentioned in the previous section, the Metro Mini can supply power to your breadboard through its pins 5V and GND. This power comes from the USB that connects your Metro Mini to the computer. Inside all USB cables there are four wires. These provide power (+5V) and ground and two wires for sending and receiving data. This is why you can use your USB cable to charge your phone as well as transfer data. YOU WILL NO LONGER NEED YOUR POWER SUPPLY to supply 5V to your breadboard. **IMPORTANT** Disconnect your power supply from your breadboard if you have not already done so.

Digital Pins
------------

The Metro Mini has 14 digital pins (labeled 0 through 13 as shown below) that can be used to control external devices from a simple LED to a complex robot. IMPORTANT: Generally you want to avoid using pins 0 and 1 if possible. Using these pins might interfere with the programming of your device.
