# Overview

So far you have just written a few commands at the command line to log into and set up your Raspberry Pi. The command line also offers complete access to the computerâ€™s file system and programs. Just as with a graphical user interface (GUI), you can complete all standard user operations of file navigation and creation, install and run software and much more.

A great tutorial can be found [here](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/&sa=D&ust=1587613174403000). Complete all the lessons.

NOTE: Before starting lesson \#6 make sure that you have installed the latest version of Vim. Vim is a text editor that you will need to create and edit files on your RPI. The following command is used to install or update Vim.

#### $ sudo apt install vim

Also note that your keyboard should have the Caps Lock and Esc keys switched i.e. hitting the Esc key should turn on caps lock and hitting the Caps Lock key should trigger escape. This Esc key is commonly used with Vim and should be easily accessible.
