# Relational Operators

## Overview

In this lesson you will learn to use the greater than and less than logical operators. The greater than operator checks if the value of a variable is greater than a compared value and the less than operator checks if the value of a variable is less than a compared value.

x \> 23 //If x is greater than 23 this returns true

X \< 23 //If x is less than 23 this returns true

## Conditionals

In this lesson you will again need to use conditionals. Note you last used a conditional in the lesson on Inputs and you can read more about conditionals [here](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BmZbXzxnD2j17QToSZ9jeZmnP7burwfksfQq2v4zu-Y/edit%23heading%3Dh.o11qq65yx4ek&sa=D&ust=1587613173938000)Â in concepts.

### Exercise:

1.  Set up your board with an LED and a potentiometer. Write a program that checks the value of the potentiometer. If it is greater than 400, the LED should turn on.
2.  Modify your code so that if the potentiometer is greater than 400, the LED should turn on. If it is less than 400, it should turn off.

3.  Add two more LEDs to your board. Write a program that turns on the first led when the value of the pot is greater than 400, the second LED when the value of the pot is greater than 600 and the third LED when the value of the pot is greater than 800.
4.  Modify your code so that the respective LEDs turn off when they are below the values given above. (i.e. the third LED turns on when the pot is greater than 800 and off when it is less than 800).
